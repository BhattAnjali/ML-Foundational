MNIST is a dataset that contains thousands of training and test images of digits 0-9 with proper labels, and resolution of 28 * 28 pixels. 
To identify the handwritten digits, the simplest classifier Nearest Neighbor Classifier is used. This classifier take the input as image and output as the digit with its specific label.
Each MNIST image is further stretched to 784 dimensional vectors, and using Eucledeon distance formula, the nearest most relatable digit is traced, and its label is given as the output.
